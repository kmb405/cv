        <p><em>Network/Software Engineer</em></p>
        <p>As a network engineer who has found a love for coding, I would like to find a position in Software Development
            that will expand my knowledge and open me up to new ideas . I have three years of experience in Python
            Automation and one year of experience in web development, and I have worked with Django and Flask
            frameworks in Python, and Spring framework in Java. I also have personal experience with building Android apps
            in Android Studio, and 3D Games in Unreal Engine. While automating, I have extensively worked with the
            Requests, OS, Netmiko, Naplam, NCClient and Pandas modules. I am self-motivated and can work with little
            direction from others, and I also work well in a team. I have always been resourceful, possessing strong analytical
            and time management skills and a well-honed ability for risk identification.</p>
